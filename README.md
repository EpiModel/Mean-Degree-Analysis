## Data

We used data from ARTnet - an anonymous cross-sectional online survey of HIV-related risk behaviors, testing, and use of prevention services among MSM in the United States. MSM were recruited from the American Mens’ Internet Survey (AMIS) Survey, so the dataset also includes variables from AMIS.

Additional documentation on ARTnet and information to accessing the data can be found [here](https://github.com/EpiModel/ARTnetData). Code to install the “ARTnetData” package can be found below, but it may require a [Github Personal Access Token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) since it is a private repository.

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("EpiModel/ARTnetData")
```

## Code Organization

The analysis script `MeanDegreeComparison.R` is the script used for analysis.
